To Kill a Mockingbird Final Assessment Project: Scrapbook 
Guiding Question: 
How do I learn about the world through literature and from the experiences others?
Your Task: 
Create a 6-8 page (3-4 double page spreads) scrapbook that can lead you to investigate/research a form of discrimination, stereotyping, or genocide around the world. Your supporting documentation/research must not be any older than November of 2011. Use this research to write three journal entries from the point of view of a person living in a country or region facing a specific type of discrimination. 
Or, you may choose a type of discrimination, genocide or stereotyping to explore from different points of view in different places around the world. Imagine that the person/group you’re focusing on has read To Kill a Mockingbird. 
You must include three quotations from To Kill a Mockingbird in each journal entry which should provide the roadmap for your project. You must explain why each quotation from To Kill a Mockingbird led you to answer the guiding question listed above. 
The scrapbook must be presented through either the eyes of the persecutors or those who are being persecuted (point of view). Choose symbols that represent the journey your character has taken. On each page, justify how the quotes that you chose led you to the research that you found. 
Creating the Scrapbook: 
You may use a Prezi, an online scrapbook or a tangible scrapbook. 
Components: Each double page spread must include: 
•   A Title: Write a title that incorporates the injustices caused by other people or nations. 
•   A Picture: Choose a picture that would explain the type of stereotype, discrimination or genocide. Please make sure the picture is school appropriate. This may be drawn or computer generated. 
o Write a caption (more than a sentence) that explains who, what, where, how and why?
 An Object: Choose an object that symbolizes the type of stereotype, description, or genocide.
o Write a caption (more than a sentence) that explains how the object symbolizes your stereotype or type of discrimination. 
•   Character traits: List adjectives to describe what these people were feeling. 
•   A journal entry: In a journalistic style, write a well-developed response from the point of view of the person being ‘persecuted’ or the person doing the persecuting. You need to be consistent in which point of view you choose to write from. Possible open-ended statements that you could use to begin your journal entries: 
I learned... I was influenced.... I changed my opinion because... 
o Include three quotations from To Kill a Mockingbird and explain them in your journal entry. For instance, you might say, “and this is what they taught me...”
o Make sure your entry has enough content that I can truly understand what you think those being discriminated against or those doing the discriminating felt. Check carefully for correct spelling and grammar. Of course, creativity, as it matches the novel, will help give your entry some personality and life. Make it authentic! 
 A correct MLA Works Cited page for your research. Don’t forget to cite your research correctly in your journal entries. 
Checklist of Tasks: 
___ 3-4 double page spreads (6-8 pages total)
___ Written from one of the two points of view (the persecutor or the persecuted) and is NOT a summary
___A title for each double page spread introducing the type of discrimination
___A picture for each double page spread including a caption (the caption addresses who, where, when, how and why)
 ___Each double page spread includes a symbolic object and a caption explaining its relevance
___Character traits are incorporated in text, or written as a list
___Three Journal Entries

During the year of 1940, our small group of four met up with the Levinsky family in hiding. Abigail always had a small romance with their oldest son, Aaron, and I thought that romance and love was silly, and didn’t understand it. Not until they were both taken in the Winter of 1941. But, let’s not get too ahead of ourselves. It was the year I developed a passion for reading. I realized that I couldn't play ball, or run around like normal kids could, but I could read in silence and take in the stories of Calico Bush and The Cat Who Went to Heaven. 

We were in the barber shop that day, and found a secret stairway to the attic. We scared the other Jewish family so bad that I thought that the Nazis in Germany could hear them. We then introduced each other and decided that we could both stay at the same place. I always thought that there was something weird about them but I had put the thought to the back of my head.

One day I asked Abigail why us Jews did not take up guns and put up a fight. I’d much rather fight and lose than get captured without even trying to escape. She held me by the shoulders and said in her serious voice, “I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.”

Sometimes I’d ask my sister why the Nazis were after us and what kind of people there are. My sister would always reply, “I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks.” I found out later on that  what she meant was that all people were born the same, and that we have to trust that what they think they are doing is right, in their eyes. She always believed that things would get better, and the war would end. Then I would say, “If there's just one kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other?” 

I could see my sister looking a bit uncomfortable, that was something hard to answer. She would say with a smile, “I’m not so sure Rebecca, but that's for you to fantasize and figure out.”

It’s quite sad how many cherishable events that you miss when you're in hiding. We never got to celebrate my little brother’s first words, and his first steps. Life seemed to pass by as a blur, always living in fear of what could happen the next         day.  What I didn’t know was the Levinsky’s plan to betray us. It was the winter of 1941, with the trees stripped of leaves, covered in snow, with the ground stained red with blood, just waiting for a new coat of fresh white to lay its hands upon it once  more. The Nazis were notified of our location and while my sister was sewing clothes and chattering with Aaron, and I was reading a book with the boys in my room, 3 soldiers with uniforms burst into the room with guns. 

I watched in horror through a crack in my door as my sister slowly put her hands up, giving me “the look” and telling me not to come out. The Nazis were screaming and telling them to pack up their stuff in 5 minutes. Then came the moment where I truly understood the meaning of love. I kept telling myself that “It’s not time to worry yet,” and that I could make it out alive, but I was losing hope. The Nazis would find me for sure. As one of them started stomping over to my room i ran to the corner and pressed my back to the wall. I grabbed each brother by their collar and prayed for our lives to stay silent.

As the handle of the door slowly turned, I shut my eyes, not wanting to see what happened next. In ten seconds, nothing. I slowly opened my eyes to hear a loud *thud*. I rushed to the door and saw Aaron wrestling with a Nazi soldier. The other two were pointing guns and screaming curses. Then, I heard a gunshot. I couldn’t look anymore. There was only silence, mostly from shock, but the 5 seconds of silence felt like hours. It didn’t seem fair that people had to die in this world. I felt sick, I almost wanted to give myself up but I knew my responsibility. Dad and Abigail are counting on me to fulfill my duties.

I understood something new that day, that it was always time to worry. People die every day from the Nazis and I can’t stop it, no matter how bad i felt, but I can stop the Nazis from taking any more of my family.
